# MapDB

[MapDB](http://www.mapdb.org/) java的数据引擎

> MapDB is an embedded database engine for Java. It provides Maps and other collections backed by disk or off-heap memory storage. MapDB is free under Apache License.
>
> MapDB is not a database, but an engine. It is not complete solution, but set of building blocks such as: memory allocators, caches, storages, indexes, transaction wrappers, serializers etc. This gives MapDB lot of flexibility and space for performance optimizations. Ever wanted off-heap cache with limited size and with disk overflow after expiry? Now its easy.
>
> MapDB also has very user friendly API. In many cases it is drop-in replacement for existing Java classes, for example on-heap Map can be replaced with off-heap Map, with just 20 characters. It is a pure-java 500K JAR with no dependencies.
