#### What is J2EE?

Using the Java 2 Platform, Standard Edition \(J2SE\) as a basis, Java 2 Platform, Enterprise Edition \(J2EE\) builds on top of this to provide the types of services that are necessary to build large scale, distributed, component based, multi-tier applications. Essentially, J2EE is a collection of APIs that can be used to build such systems, although this is only half of the picture. J2EE is also a standard for building and deploying enterprise applications, held together by the specifications of the APIs that it defines and the services that J2EE provides. In other words, this means that the "write once, run anywhere" promises of Java apply for enterprise applications too:

* Enterprise applications can be run on different platforms supporting the Java 2 platform.
* Enterprise applications are portable between application servers supporting the J2EE specification.

  **What does J2EE comprise?**

J2EE is comprised of many APIs that can be used to build enterprise applications. Although the total list of APIs initially seems overwhelming, it is worth bearing in mind that some are primarily used by the J2EE environment in which your application executes, while some provide services that your specific application may not require. Therefore, it is worth remembering that you don't have to use all of them in order to build J2EE applications. For completeness, however, the full list of technologies that make up J2EE is as follows:

* Java Servlets
* JavaServer Pages \(JSP\)
* Enterprise JavaBeans \(EJB\)
* Java Message Service \(JMS\)
* Java Naming and Directory Interface \(JNDI\)
* Java Database Connectivity \(JDBC\)
* JavaMail
* Java Transaction Service \(JTS\)
* Java Transaction API \(JTA\)
* J2EE Connector Architecture \(J2EE-CA, or JCA\)

From a developer perspective, the main technologies are EJB, JSP, Java Servlets, JDBC and JMS, although JNDI is used for locating EJBs and other enterprise resources. For the moment, let's take a quick look at some of these technologies before moving on to see how to get started with J2EE.
